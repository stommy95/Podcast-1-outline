## The T in VT podcast

### Introduction- around two minutes
This is the introduction section where I will start off with a sound clip from the song enter the sandman by metallica. This will play for first 30-45 seconds. 
"Hellooo Vietnam! this is Tommy Skeen...." I will introduce myself, my major and minor as well as my main topic of discussion for this podcast and background information.

### The horizontal aspect of the T- around 4 minutes 
This section i will describe the horizontal component and its overall importance. "this component is described as pathways to general education to pormote critical thinking and problem solving." "For virignia tech students this component is the general core areas every student has to take for first couple years at Virginia Tech, whether that is an astronomy class for an english major or an history class for an engineer major these are the core foundations of your higher education curriculum."

### The vertical aspect of the T- around 4 minutes
This section I will describe the vertical component and its overall importance to the theory. "This aspect of the T-shaped learner is decribed as the disciplinary strengths of your education, so this aspect would be the actual courses for your major. For example, I am a multimedia and journalism major as described before which means classes like sports journalism and media effects are part of my vertical component of the t-shaped student"

### Recommendations/ Conclusion- around 2 minutes 
This section I will start with basic recommendations for a future VT student as well as my plan/ goals with my education as a T-shaped student. "Well although I see myself as a VT-shaped student I was not the best student for a while here at Virginia Tech. I urge all incoming students to not think about the present and your next weekend plans, but, to think about five maybe ten years from now and how you want to look back on your education. Did I even really give it my best?"
This section will then close out with a short snippet of the insrumental of bron-yr-aur song by led zepplin
